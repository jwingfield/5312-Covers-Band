# 53:12 - Bradford Based Covers Band
53:!2 are a 5-piece covers band from Bradford.  Our set list covers a wide range of music starting in the 60's with songs from the Beatles to the Buzzcocks, the Kaisers to the Killers and Stereophonics to Snow Patrol. We play everything for everyone and will give you a great night out.
Over the years, we've played all over Bradford with a mixture of pubs and private parties.  We were also the first band to play at the Saltaire Festival way back in 2007.  Some of the faces have changed over the years, but Woody, Scotty and Ed still form the core of the band.
